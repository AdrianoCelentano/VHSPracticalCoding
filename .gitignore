# Android Studio Log files (optional, but good to ignore)
*.log

# macOS specific files
.DS_Store

# Build directory
/build/

# Output directories for built files
/app/build/
/captures/ # If this is where Android Studio saves screenshots/screen recordings

# Native build files (if you have NDK components)
.externalNativeBuild/
.cxx/

# Gradle files
.gradletasknamecache/ # Gradle task history
gradle-wrapper.jar # If you want everyone to use the gradlew script with the defined wrapper
# Some teams commit gradle-wrapper.jar, others don't.
# If you ignore it, ensure everyone knows how to generate it if missing (./gradlew wrapper)

# Secrets and sensitive information
# It's crucial not to commit API keys or other secrets.
# local.properties is already ignored, which is good for SDK location.
# Consider adding other potential secret files if you use them.
# Example:
# secrets.properties
# *.keystore
# google-services.json # If you download it directly and don't want to commit it,
                      # but usually this is versioned if not containing sensitive info.
                      # If it does contain sensitive info, use environment variables or
                      # other secure methods to inject it during build.

# Lint results (optional, some teams commit them for tracking)
lint-results-*.xml
lint-results-*.html

# Profiling files (optional)
*.hprof
*.snapshot

# Test related files (if generated and not needed in VCS)
/app/test-results/
/app/build/reports/
/app/build/outputs/apk/androidTest/
/app/build/outputs/androidTest-results/

# Hilt/Dagger generated files (if they appear outside /build and you don't want to track them)
# Usually these are inside /build/generated, which is already covered by /build/
# If you see specific generated files outside /build you want to ignore, add them here.
# For example, if you see them at the root of a module:
# /app/generated/

# Firebase Crashlytics generated files (if any outside /build)
# Usually handled, but if you see specific files:
# crashlytics.properties
# fabric.properties

# Generated code from other annotation processors (if not in /build)

# User-specific local files (example, if someone uses a specific tool)
# my-local-tool-config.xml

### IntelliJ specific files that might not be fully covered by .idea/ ###
# These are often covered, but being explicit can sometimes help if .idea/ itself is accidentally committed.
# .idea/compiler.xml
# .idea/jarRepositories.xml
# .idea/gradle.xml
# .idea/misc.xml
# .idea/vcs.xml # Usually you want to commit this one if your team shares VCS settings

# If you use Buck, add Buck files
# buck-out/
# .buckd/

# If you use Bazel, add Bazel files
# bazel-*/

# Remove duplicate local.properties (already at the top)
